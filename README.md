# pregex
A lightweight and fast C/C++ library for regex parsing and tokenizing results, initially designed as a pure ANSI C project for the AVR micro-controllers later converted to a C++ class.

To compile for a Release build (performance-optimized, default):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
To configure for a Debug build (with debugging flags):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```
